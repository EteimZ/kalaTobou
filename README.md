# kalaTobou
Building an interface capable of speaking the Ijaw language.

The objective of this project is preserve our indigenous language.
I plan on building an interface which can speak the ijaw language.
Along time ago computers could only display text but as of now,
computers can talk and even listen to you, but what language do
they speak well English, French and the rest, what does this mean
for these languages, well it means that there is a lower chance of
them  getting extinct. I want to preserve the ijaw language by
building what i call 'kalaTobou', which means 'small child',
i hope that in the future kalaTobou will be like apple's siri or
amazon's alexa but the difference is he speaks and understands the
ijaw language. I also hope that kalaTobou project will extend to other
indigenous language in Nigeria. We will have robots teaching
students our mother tongue, there by preserving our languages.
